# Mycommute

My-Commute is a chrome extension to enhance your <a href="https://www.finn.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finn.no</a> experience.

The extension will replace the address property for the real estate page with a Google Maps link. Google Maps will open in a new tab with the property address as departure and a predefined address as destination with your travel mode of choice.
